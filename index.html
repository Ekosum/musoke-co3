    <h1>My First Webpages ever</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first time I am dealing with HTML and these are my web pages
      that that i have created. I still undecided on what I should major in; I
      am hoping this class can help me figure that part out. I want to learn
      how web pages work and all there is to know about web creation and this
      will hopefully help me make my decision.

      This page has seen massive changes ever since I started it in the class as
      the more I learnt in class the more I would add to the page. I am gong to
      keep working
    </p>

    <h2>Progress in the class</h2>
    <p>
      Things are not to bad as they were for me in the beginning of this class.
      I have learnt a lot of stuff that I didn't know in the beginning. I am happy
      with my progress this far into the coarse. I made my mind up and I am going
      to major in web development an excited to learn more and better my knowledge.
      Still have a lot to learn to learn but I will get there step by step. A man
      once said "Akwta empola atuuka wala" meaning a person who is patient will
      get to places. That being me in this case.

      Now its the end of the semester, I can say I have learnt a lot in this class
      made a few friends here and there and I can say this class has been a good
      experience overall.
