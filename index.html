    <h1>My First Webpages ever</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first time I am dealing with HTML and these are my webpages
      that that i have created. I still undecided on what I should major in; I
      am hoping this class can help me figure that part out. I want to learn
      how webpages work and all there is to know about web creation and this
      will hopefully help me make my decision.
    </p>

    <h2>Progress in the class</h2>
    <p>
      Things are not to bad as they were for me in the beginning of this class.
      I have learnt alot of stuff that I didn't know in the beginning. I am happy
      with my progress this far into the coarse. I made my mind up and I am going
      to major in web development an excited to learn more and better my knowledge.
      Still have alot to learn to learn but I will get there step by step. A man
      once said "Akwta empola atuuka wala" meaning a person who is patient will
      get to places. That being me in this case.
