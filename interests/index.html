        Uganda is a country in East Africa. The country has abundant wildlife,
        it is home to the endangered mountain gorillas and has nearly 1,061
        different bird species. The tourist infrastructure in the country is well
        developed. Uganda is a perfect vacation spot for those that like to visit
        a country with a tropical climate. The official language of Uganda is
        English, but languages such as Swahili and Luganda are also used.
        There are several tribes in the country all speaking different languages
        all having different cultures making a visit to every region interesting.
        This mainly due to different cultures and norm. The local currency is
